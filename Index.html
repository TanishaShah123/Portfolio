            <p>Throughout history, lots of people around the world have faced discrimination- where they are treated differently because of their skin colour, gender, age and lots of other things. But nowhere was this as bad as in South Africa where for more than 100 years, white minority ruled with an iron fist and there were no right for blacks with a system called Apartheid where blacks were 2nd class citizens. But Nelson Mandela who we also know as Madiba, has worked hard to make a change for the better, and help us move towards a world where everyone is treated fairly and equally.
